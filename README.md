# Deep Learning and its Application for Processing and Analysis of Signals and Images - Final Project



## Running

To get the results of the training history directly, simply download the .pkl from  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_gNoFXSY1zrKzNce2diBsnJkZr1WXkLR?usp=sharing into the runs folder.
For .pt files of model weights contact us specifically at nikolaik@post.bgu.ac.il since they are to large to store at Drive.

### Option 1: 

Run the notebook (note: you will have to sign up for kaggle and generate a kaggle.json file to download the dataset directly form kaggle.)

### Option 2: 

Download the wheat detection challenge data form Kaggle and put the train folder, test folder, and train.csv into the data directory
In the main.py file:

Uncomment whatever code block you are interested in ( training 3 times a new model, showing test results or ploting graph results) and run the code.
